## Introduction

> In this work, we introduce an improved BERT-style image pre-training method, namely mc-BEiT, which performs MIM proxy tasks towards eased and refined multi-choice training objectives. Specifically, the multi-choice supervision for the masked image patches is formed by the soft probability vectors of the discrete token ids, which are predicted by the off-the-shelf image ``tokenizer'' and further refined by high-level inter-patch perceptions resorting to the observation that similar patches should share their choices.
